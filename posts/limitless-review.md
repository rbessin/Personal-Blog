### Summary [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless)
Eddie Morra is a struggling author in New York City. His girlfriend Lindy, frustrated with his lack of progress (as well as his seeming lack of ambition, motivation, and focus), breaks up with him. Eddie encounters Vernon, the brother of his ex-wife Melissa, who gives him a sample of a new nootropic called NZT-48, which Vernon implies will help Eddie with his "creative problems". On the drug, Eddie discovers that he has acquired perfect recall, and is able to analyze minute details and information at incredible speed. As the pill takes effect, he is being yelled at by his landlord's wife. With his new power, he calms her down, helps her with her law school homework, and sleeps with her. His abilities compel him to tidy up his apartment and give him immense inspiration for his book.

Eddie goes to Vernon’s apartment to get more information on the pill, and finds him beaten up. Refusing to tell him what happened, Vernon sends Eddie to run errands for him. When Eddie gets back, he finds Vernon murdered, prompting him to call the police. Eddie locates Vernon's supply and with that, he is able to finish his book.

As his life improves, he decides to begin investing in the stock market, which proves to be highly successful. Wanting to make more money, he takes a loan from Gennady, a shady loan shark, who tells him that, if he can’t pay him back the loan, he will kill him. He is hired at a brokerage firm and resumes his relationship with Lindy. His success leads to a meeting with finance tycoon Carl Van Loon, who tests him by seeking advice on a merger with Hank Atwood's company. After the meeting, Eddie experiences an 18-hour loss of memory, which he refers to as a "time skip".

The next day, before going in a meeting with Van Loon, Eddie finds out his NZT-48 supply ran out, forcing him to go to the meeting without it. During the meeting, Eddie sees a news telecast that a woman has been murdered in her hotel room. Eddie recognizes her as the woman he slept with during his time skip and abruptly leaves the meeting.

Eddie realizes that everyone taking NZT-48 is either hospitalized or dead. A man in a trench coat is revealed to have been following him. Lindy tells Eddie she cannot be with him while he is on the drug. Eddie experiments with NZT-48 and learns to control his dosage, sleep schedule, and food intake to prevent side effects. He hires a laboratory in an attempt to reverse-engineer the drug, an attorney to keep the police from investigating the death of Vernon or the woman, and two bodyguards to protect him from Gennady, who is threatening him to obtain more NZT-48.

On the day of the merger, Atwood falls into a coma. Eddie recognizes Atwood's driver as the man in the trench coat and realizes Atwood is on NZT-48. While Eddie participates in a police lineup, his attorney steals Eddie's supply of pills from his jacket pocket. Eddie enters into withdrawal, and while Van Loon questions him about Atwood's coma, Eddie receives a parcel that is found to contain the severed hands of his bodyguards. He hurries home and locks himself in, before Gennady breaks into Eddie's apartment, demanding more NZT-48. Gennady flaunts his abilities while injecting himself with NZT-48, explaining that by injecting it directly into the bloodstream, the effects last longer and the withdrawal symptoms are lessened. As Gennady threatens to eviscerate him, Eddie grabs his own knife and kills Gennady. Eddie then consumes Gennady's blood to ingest the NZT-48 in the blood. This gives Eddie the mental abilities of the drug once again, and he is able to kill the remaining henchmen. He then meets with the man in the trench coat, surmising that Atwood employed the man to locate more NZT-48. Once Atwood dies, the two recover Eddie's stash from his attorney's apartment.

A year later, Eddie has retained his wealth, published a book, and is running for the United States Senate. Van Loon visits him and reveals that he has absorbed the company that produced NZT-48 and shut down Eddie's laboratory and both acknowledge that Eddie will likely become President of the United States one day, so Van Loon offers Eddie a continued supply of the drug in exchange for Eddie becoming his political backing. Eddie tells Van Loon that he has already perfected the drug and weaned himself off it, retaining his abilities without side effects. Defeated, Van Loon leaves.

Eddie goes to lunch with Lindy. After Eddie speaks in fluent-sounding Chinese with the waiter, Lindy looks at Eddie suspiciously, wondering if he's really off NZT. He looks at Lindy and says "What?"

### My Thoughts
One evening during summer vacation, I found the time to watch Limitless. Not knowing what the movie was about, I disovered everything while watching the movie. Blending thriller characteristics with a novel sci-fi idea, I thought the movie was deeply original and well thought out if not for the few stereotypical scenes. Drugs have been known to alter brain chemistry for quite a while now, but taking advantage of one of these drugs to enhance one's ability is something that hasn't been explored very much yet. I found this concept to be very believable and thought it developed well another part of the movie, the negative effects often ignored intially about drugs which in this case lead to death. While, this part of the drug is discussed multiple times, I was dissapointed by the lack of depth and detail surrounding this issue. The encounters which present the drug as deadly and extremely dangerous stop there. I think if this movie had reduced the complexity of the story by getting rid of the exploration of his career as a writer or by removing links to his previous relationships, that additional time could've been decidated to an in depth exploration of the company or people behind the drug and potentially even a storyline ending in a more in depth comprehension about why these deaths take place. Apart from this I thought the timeline was well though out by sparking the viewer's curiosity at the start with a scene filled with suspense, I thought the narration fit in well with the overall style of the movie helping feel closer to the main character and finally I thought the suspense and action was well managed keeping the viewer on the edge of his seat at certain intervals such as during the fight scene in the main character's appartment. Overall I thought the ending was adequate, showing the fight against addiction and the difficulty to completely eradicate a certain drug from one's lifestyle once you've become accustomed to it.

### Recommendation
I do recommend this movie giving it around **7 stars** (out of 10) because it is well made as I've said but do not expect this to be one of the best movies you've ever seen.
