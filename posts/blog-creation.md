Next.js provides many useful tools to create blogs such as **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**, **SEO Management**, and **more...** This, combined with my sparking interest in movies, tv shows, books, politics, etc. has led me to look into sharing my perspectives, new found knowledge, and questions. Initially I wanted to create more projects to showcase my skills, but I also wanted to get back into web development. For a few months, I had been working on projects in Unity before learning about Godot, and getting into scenes and nodes. But that's a story for another time. So I thought creating a blog would be the perfect opportunity to get back into web development while starting with a simple project. This post initially stood as a **placeholder** when testing and creating the blog website. So if you see this, this is the **oldest post** on the platform. While it doesn't hold much content, it's value goes beyong that for me. I hope to add a lot of content to this blog in future days, weeks and months.
