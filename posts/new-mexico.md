---### Why New Mexico ?
As a French family, when we arrived in the US we wanted to discover all that there was to see and do! And so, every vacation we could we traveled to a different US state, visiting California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina and more. However, we had heard of New Mexico for its pristine landscapes, fascinating monuments, distinguished art, and interesting people, but had never gone. So we set off on December 20th for 10 days.

### What did we do ?
It was such an amazing experience. The landscapes alone with dozens of different shades of red and orange were extremely pretty. Everywhere, you could see mountains and plateaus. After visiting the peak of a mountain and dining at a restaurant there, visiting caves that spanned kilometers and chilling in hot tubs filled with natural spring water, I was captivated. We ended up visiting nearly a dozen galleries as well as the Georgia O'Keeffe museum and taking memorable pictures. This is where our second trip started, which made us journey through the renowned TV show, Breaking Bad, visiting an important house in the show as well as a small store/museum which had props from the actual show. There was also a lot of driving involved which helped us bond as a family, but also which gave me time to read and finish the Handmaid's Tale as well as listen to a lot of music...

### What else ? 
Overall, it was also a hard time for me because I had been talking to a girl for a while and during the break it was hard for her to find time for me. I felt very far away from her and started understanding what was really going on. However, it gave me an opportunity to grow much closer to my brother, which hadn't always been the case. We talked during the day and spent a few hours one evening talking about our lives, meditation, friends... 

### Overall I truly recommend visiting New Mexico. It was an amazing experience and truly made me discover a beauty, that was vastly different from the beauty you find in New York.
